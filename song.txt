Song by Alt-J

Something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now
Get high
Hit the floor before you go
Matador
Estocada, you're my blood sport
But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now

48 thousand seats
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
Get high
Hit the floor before you go
Matador
Estocada, you're my blood sport
48 thousand seats
Bleats and roars for my memories of you
Now that I am clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
But something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good
Oh, something good tonight
Will make me forget about you for now
